# Cryptocurrency App made with React

Cryptocurrency is something that has interested me since hearing about people building rigs and people conversing about Non Fungible Tokens. So with that interest in mind I decided to create a Crypto web app that has 100 coins and Coin Gecko API. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, React-Redux, Ant Design, Chart.JS

I have been getting deeper into React and wanted to see how I could push myself to use a different UI library such as Material UI. Material UI has great docs and allowed for me to use create a nice UI to display the project. I used Axios for the API calls. For the API's I went to Coin Gecko where they list over 12,279 coins. For the individual coins I went and used Chart.JS to have each coin show the 24 Hour, 30 Day, 3 Month, 1 Year charts.

## Lessons Learned:

When working with this project I had to learn how to manage the API calls as well as how to display the information that I wanted from the API. I also learned that having a UI library makes your life easier as you can concentrate on building your web app much quicker than having to do all the UI yourself.
